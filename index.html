                                Tammy Fournier Alsaada, a longtime community activist, tearfully recalls the trauma that haunted her as she and others were protesting in her city. 
                                “In that moment, they launched a war on the citizens during that afternoon,” said Alsaada. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Alsaada, who is a community organizer of the People's Justice Project, a non-profit that focuses on uplifting minorities of color impacted by violence and mass criminalization centering community organizing and leadership,
                                said that she along with hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Columbus, Ohio to protest police violence in the wake of the killing of George Floyd.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What started as a peaceful protest, escalated into violence as she along with other protesters were tear gassed and assaulted by police officers.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The result of the injuries from protesters is what led to Alsaada along with 31 other plaintiffs to file a federal lawsuit against the city.
